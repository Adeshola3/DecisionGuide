          "explanation": "Tier: 🟢 Tier 3 – Low Risk\n\nThe vendor does not access systems and does not process your data.\n\n---\n\nWhat to request:\n\n- Basic contract\n- Pricing details\n- Delivery or service terms\n\n---\n\nNot required:\n\n- No Data Processing Agreement (DPA)\n- No Service Level Agreement (SLA)\n- No security questionnaires\n- No SOC 2 or ISO 27001 evidence\n\n---\n\nExamples:\n\n- Stationery supplier\n- Catering services\n- Cleaning company\n- Uniform suppliers\n- Furniture providers\n\n---\n\nOfficial guidance and references:\n\n- ICO Data Protection Basics: https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/data-protection-basics\n- UK Procurement Policy Notes (PPNs): https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/procurement-policy-notes\n\n---\n\nWhy this matters:\n\nThese vendors create almost no security or privacy exposure. The aim is to keep processes lightweight so procurement isn't slowed down by unnecessary checks."

Baseline data handling and storage checks ensure responsible use without overburdening suppliers."

        "Personal data or integration (e.g. HR, CRM, payroll, SaaS logins, API services)": {

These requirements provide assurance that the vendor maintains mature security controls and transparent data flows."

        "Critical/high-impact service (e.g. cloud hosting, identity providers, core platforms)": {
          "decision": "TIER_0_CRITICAL",
          "explanation": "Tier: 🔴 Tier 0 – Critical\n\nThe vendor provides a core service or has privileged access where failure would disrupt operations.\n\n---\n\nWhat to request:\n\n- DPA (if personal data is processed)\n- Strong contract with mandatory security clauses\n- SOC 2 Type II and/or ISO 27001 certification\n- Penetration test results or assurance report\n- Security architecture overview\n- MFA and privileged access controls\n- SLA with high uptime guarantees\n- BCM and DR documentation with testing evidence\n- Incident notification within 24 hours\n- Detailed off-boarding and data deletion plan\n\n---\n\nExamples:\n\n- AWS, Azure, GCP\n- Enterprise-wide identity providers (Okta, Entra)\n- Core clinical or business platforms\n- Payment processors\n- Managed service providers with admin access\n\n---\n\nOfficial guidance and references:\n\n- NCSC Supply Chain Security: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/supply-chain-security\n- NCSC Cloud Security Principles: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cloud\n- ISO 22301 Business Continuity Standard: https://www.iso.org/standard/75106\n- PRA/FCA Operational Resilience Requirements: https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation\n- EU DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act): https://finance.ec.europa.eu/regulation-and-supervision/financial-services-legislation/digital-finance/dora_en\n\n---\n\nWhy this matters:\n\nCritical vendors create organisational dependency. A failure, outage, or breach could halt operations or create regulatory exposure. These references and requirements ensure resilience, incident readiness, and accountability."
