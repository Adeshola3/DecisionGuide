      "options": {
        "No data and no system access (e.g. stationery, catering, cleaning, uniforms)": {
          "decision": "TIER_3_LOW",
          "explanation": "Tier: Tier 3 – Low Risk\n\nThe vendor does not access systems and does not process your data.\n\n---\n\nWhat to request:\n\n- Basic contract\n- Pricing details\n- Delivery or service terms\n\n---\n\nNot required:\n\n- No Data Processing Agreement (DPA)\n- No Service Level Agreement (SLA)\n- No security questionnaires\n- No SOC 2 or ISO 27001 evidence\n\n---\n\nExamples:\n\n- Stationery supplier\n- Catering services\n- Cleaning company\n- Uniform suppliers\n- Furniture providers\n\n---\n\nWhy this matters:\n\nBecause the vendor has no system access and processes no data, the security and privacy risk is extremely low. Keeping requirements light avoids unnecessary delays and helps procurement move faster."
        },
        "Low/internal data only (e.g. training tools, survey apps, booking tools)": {
          "decision": "TIER_2_MEDIUM",
          "explanation": "Tier: Tier 2 – Medium Risk\n\nThe vendor handles low-sensitivity or internal-only data.\n\n---\n\nWhat to request:\n\n- Light SLA covering response times\n- High-level security or privacy policy\n- Data storage region (e.g. UK, EU, US)\n- Data retention period\n- DPA only if any personal data is involved\n\n---\n\nNot required:\n\n- SOC 2 or ISO 27001 as mandatory evidence\n- Large or complex security questionnaires\n- Disaster Recovery or Business Continuity documentation\n\n---\n\nExamples:\n\n- Staff training and learning platforms\n- Internal survey tools\n- Department-only scheduling or booking tools\n- Simple SaaS utilities used internally\n\n---\n\nWhy this matters:\n\nThese services touch internal or operational data but do not introduce major risk. The goal is to confirm they handle data responsibly without overwhelming the vendor with enterprise-level requirements."
        },
        "Personal data or integration (e.g. HR, CRM, payroll, SaaS logins, API services)": {
          "decision": "TIER_1_HIGH",
          "explanation": "Tier: Tier 1 – High Risk\n\nThe vendor processes personal data and/or integrates with your systems.\n\n---\n\nWhat to request:\n\n- Data Processing Agreement (DPA)\n- Sub-processor list\n- SLA covering uptime and support\n- ISO 27001, SOC 2, or penetration test evidence\n- MFA and access control summary\n- Data flow diagram\n- Incident notification commitment (e.g. 48 hours)\n- Exit and data deletion plan\n\n---\n\nExamples:\n\n- HR systems with staff information\n- CRM platforms with customer or client data\n- Payroll or timekeeping providers\n- SaaS applications requiring login accounts\n- API services sending or receiving your data\n\n---\n\nWhy this matters:\n\nPersonal data and system integrations increase both privacy risk and cyber exposure. These requirements ensure the vendor has strong security controls and that you understand how your data moves through their service."
        },
        "Critical/high-impact service (e.g. cloud hosting, identity providers, core platforms)": {
          "decision": "TIER_0_CRITICAL",
          "explanation": "Tier: Tier 0 – Critical\n\nThe vendor supports critical services or has privileged access where failure would disrupt the organisation.\n\n---\n\nWhat to request:\n\n- Data Processing Agreement (if personal data is processed)\n- Strong contract with clear security and incident clauses\n- SOC 2 Type II and/or ISO 27001\n- Recent penetration test summary\n- Security architecture overview\n- MFA and privileged access controls\n- SLA with uptime guarantees\n- Business Continuity (BCM) and Disaster Recovery (DR) documentation with testing evidence\n- Incident notification within an agreed short timeframe (e.g. 24 hours)\n- Detailed exit plan with confirmed data deletion\n\n---\n\nExamples:\n\n- AWS, Azure, GCP (cloud hosting)\n- Enterprise identity provider (e.g. Okta, Entra)\n- Core clinical or business systems\n- Payment processors\n- Managed service providers with admin access\n\n---\n\nWhy this matters:\n\nCritical vendors create direct operational dependency. A failure, outage, or breach would significantly impact your organisation. These requirements ensure resilience, strong security assurance, rapid incident handling, and a safe exit strategy."
