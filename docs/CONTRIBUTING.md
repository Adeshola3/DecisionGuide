# Contributing to DecisionGuide

DecisionGuide is an open-source, logic-based assistant for governance, risk, and audit decisions.

This project is especially welcoming to:
- GRC professionals
- Risk and audit analysts
- Non-technical contributors with strong domain knowledge

## Ways to contribute

- Suggest new decision trees (e.g. vendor assessments, DPIA triggers, SLA logic).
- Improve or correct the logic of existing trees.
- Suggest better wording for questions or outcomes.
- Share feedback on how you would use this in real assessments.

If you are not comfortable with GitHub, you can:
- Share your ideas through a form or document, and they will be translated into decision logic and added with full credit.

## Credit and attribution

- Meaningful contributors will be listed (with their consent) in the README under a **Contributors** section.
- You are welcome to reference this project and your contribution on your CV or portfolio.

More detailed contribution workflows will be added as the project grows.
